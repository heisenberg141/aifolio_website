Hello, my name is `Hitesh`, and I am a `robotics software engineer` with `3+ years` of experience in the field. My area of expertise lies in developing intelligent robotic systems that leverage computer vision and deep learning algorithms to perform complex tasks autonomously.

I am currently pursuing Masters degree in Robotics Engineering from [WPI](https://wpi.edu) and have extensive experience in developing custom robotics solutions for various industries including research, manufacturing, and logistics. My expertise in computer vision and deep learning has allowed me to design and deploy robotic systems that can recognize and interpret visual data, and perform complex tasks such as `object detection`, `segmentation`, and `tracking`.

Throughout my career, I have worked on several projects that involved developing algorithms and techniques for `SLAM`, `sensor fusion`, `perception`, `structure from motion`, and deep learning. I have a deep understanding of the underlying principles of these technologies and have extensive experience in implementing them for various applications, such as `mapping`, `localization`, and `navigation`.

In my previous roles, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement autonomous robotic systems that can operate safely and efficiently in real-world environments. I have also conducted extensive research on the latest advancements in computer vision and deep learning to identify new opportunities for innovation and improvement in robotic systems.

I am now seeking new challenges in a role that allows me to leverage my skills and experience in robotics, computer vision, and deep learning. I am passionate about creating intelligent and autonomous systems that can make a positive impact on society and am excited to contribute to a team that shares my vision.
